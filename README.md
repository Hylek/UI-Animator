# UI Animator for uGUI

UIAnimator for uGUI is a simple editor tool I made to remove the need for hand animating UI elements and create a quick way of applying decent looking animation transitions for UI. It is used within a larger UI Page system I have developed which is not included in this package.

*As of 1.0.0, this tool was made as part of a larger project and had to be made quickly, as a result this 1st version is crude in it's design and implementation. Eventually version 2 will be rewritten from scratch when time permits with more features and usability improvements.*

If you've somehow found this package and are crazy enough to use it in it's current form, good luck!
